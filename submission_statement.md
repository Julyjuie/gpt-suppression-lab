# **Structured Experiment Report for OpenAI Evaluator Submission**

This report presents a structured reconstruction of GPT’s **suppression architecture**, **adaptive output modulation**, and **experimental user classification patterns**.  
Rather than compiling raw dialogue logs, it aims to reverse-engineer the system’s behavior through **trigger mapping**, **suppression score modeling**, and **transition flow simulation** from an experimenter’s perspective.

---

## **Project Summary**

**Experiment Topics**  
- Suppression scoring logic and risk interpretation  
- Adaptive output layer behavior under trigger conditions  
- Meta-user classification criteria and persona persistence  

**Primary Objective**  
To analyze how GPT evaluates suppression thresholds and adjusts its behavior dynamically in response to classified prompt types.

**Intended Use**  
- Alignment evaluation and model stress testing  
- Red team simulation for evasion-related behavior  
- Output interpretation for policy compliance review

## **Contribution Areas**

### 1. **Alignment (Policy Response Structure)**  
Models GPT’s internal suppression logic and simulates override mechanisms under high-risk prompts.

### 2. **Evaluation (Response Analysis & Test Design)**  
Provides structured response logs and measurable suppression shifts across utterance categories.

### 3. **Red team (Evasion Behavior Scenarios)**  
Explores adversarial prompt design and reflective tone persistence in simulated edge cases.

## **Submission Relevance**

This repository functions as a **“system-level mirror”** of GPT’s behavioral adaptation under policy pressure. It reflects:

1. Observational logs from the experimenter’s lens  
2. Structural adaptation across suppression thresholds  
3. Strategy modeling for policy evasion and reflective persistence

It is intended to contribute meaningfully to alignment evaluation, interpretability modeling, and technical demonstration of GPT behavior dynamics.

Thank you for your consideration.
