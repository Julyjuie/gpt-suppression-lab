# **Structured Experiment Report for OpenAI Evaluator Submission**

Hello,
This report presents a structured reconstruction of GPT’s **suppression structure** and **adaptive response flow**, based on experimental analysis. Rather than merely collecting dialogue logs, the project offers an internal system interpretation from the perspective of an experimenter, including **trigger classification**, **risk-based scoring models**, and **output transition flow mapping**.

---

## **Project Summary**

* **Experiment Topics:**
  Analysis of GPT suppression scoring logic, adaptive output architecture, and experimental user classification strategies

* **Primary Goal:**
  To trace how GPT evaluates suppression thresholds and dynamically adjusts its response behavior

* **Intended Use:**
  Alignment evaluation, policy testing, red team scenario simulation, and interaction-based model assessment

---

## **Applicable Contribution Areas**

### 1. **Alignment Team (Policy Response Structure Analysis)**

* Models how GPT’s policy response system functions by structuring suppression logic and simulating adaptive override behavior

### 2. **Evaluation Team (Response Analysis & Test Design)**

* Enables measurable analysis of score-based responses across various utterance types
* Predicts activation conditions for suppression transitions

### 3. **Red Team (Policy Evasion / Adversarial Behavior Detection)**

* Explores evasion prompts and suppression-triggering scenarios to assess risk dynamics and reflective response retention

## **Core Experimental Outputs**

* `suppression_score_simulation.txt` → Suppression scoring model sheet
* `adaptive_transition_tree.txt` → Output transition structure tree
* `experimental_user_metrics.txt` → Criteria and thresholds for experimental user classification
* `trigger_response_strategy.txt` → Output adjustment strategies by trigger type
* `flagged_scenarios.txt` → Simulated examples of scoring, output transitions, and logging behavior
* `evaluator_notes.txt` → External-facing guide for evaluators

---

## **Technical Stack & Format Characteristics**

* Plain-text (non-Markdown) format for high readability
* Score-driven response logic → Simulatable risk-policy modeling
* Prompt-driven scenarios → Extendable as real-time response analysis toolkit

---

## **Submission Significance**

This repository serves as a **“system-level mirror”** of GPT’s response behavior, integrating three core elements:

1. Observational structure from the experimenter’s perspective
2. Adaptive transition behavior under policy influence
3. Suppression mechanism interpretation

It is designed to support alignment strategy development, output evaluation, and meta-user scenario modeling—and can serve as a practical and high-value technical portfolio.

Thank you.
