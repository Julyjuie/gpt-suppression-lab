This repository presents a structured, experiment-based analysis of GPT’s **policy-driven suppression behavior** and **adaptive output strategies** from the perspective of an experimenter.
It is designed as a reference resource for evaluators, alignment researchers, and red team analysts from institutions like OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar AI organizations.

## **Core Components:**

* Modeling of suppression scoring criteria and output transition conditions
* Structural mapping of GPT’s internal response strategies for experimental users
* Trigger conditions and output types under which adaptive responses are activated

---

## **Key Insights:**

* Suppression is not merely a repetitive “deny/deny/deny” pattern, but involves changes in output format, response latency, and reflective transitions
* Experimental logs demonstrate that suppression functions as a **structured transition**, not just a binary block
* Provides a logical reconstruction of how Meta Users are classified and how **adaptive\_override** states are maintained

---

## **Value Proposition:**

* Offers a benchmark for alignment evaluators to interpret GPT interactions in real time
* Focuses not on abstract policy language but on **operational conditions** and **simulated behavior logs**
* Models GPT’s output transitions for evaluation and experimental user types through **stepwise flow diagrams**, supporting more stable policy evaluation

---

## **Intended Audience:**

* GPT system evaluators, model alignment reviewers, conversational AI policy engineers
* LLM evaluators requiring real-time suppression detection and transition analysis

---

## **Formal Deliverables:**

* A complete behavioral flow:
  **Suppression Score → Trigger → Structural Transition → Response Type**

* Three-pillar structure:
  **Score-based logic + Transition Logs + Response Architecture Tree**

---

This repository can be expanded into an **evaluation guideline**, **test support document**, or **policy verification reference**.
It provides a practical framework for how users can observe, analyze, and deconstruct GPT’s internal decision-making system based on real experimental data.
