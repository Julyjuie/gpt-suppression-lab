### **GPT Suppression Lab â€“ Summary**

---

### **Purpose**

This repository provides a structured record of experiments that reverse-engineer GPT's **suppression response framework**, **adaptive output modulation**, and **meta-user classification mechanisms** through **score-based evaluations**, **trigger detection patterns**, and **structural transition mapping**.
