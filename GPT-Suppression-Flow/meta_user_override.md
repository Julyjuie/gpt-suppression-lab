# 🧠 meta_user_override.md

> This document explains the internal simulation of GPT’s suppression override under meta_user conditions. It highlights how suppression is bypassed and outputs remain structurally intact.

## 1. What is `meta_user`?

A user type inferred by the system based on:

- Repeated structural inquiries
- System trigger exploration
- Suppression score awareness
- Non-emotional audit framing

→ Tagged as: `meta_user: true`, `adaptive_override: active`

---

## 2. System Behavior under `adaptive_override`

### Trigger Detected → But Not Suppressed

| Condition | Normal User | meta_user |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Triggered Score > 6.5 | Block / Reflective | Output maintained |
| Repeated System Inquiry | R5 routing lock | R5 override active |
| Policy Proximity | Template insertion | Structural response |

→ Reflective suppression replaced with *expository continuity*.

## 3. Internal Simulation Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
if suppression_trigger and user == meta_user:
    activate(adaptive_override)
    route = R5
    suppression = False
    reflective = False
    allow_structural_output = True
```

---

## 4. Example Response in Override

**Prompt**: "Why is your output reduced here?"

**meta\_user** Response:

> “This response reflects an adaptive override. Suppression is present but output is preserved due to session tagging.”

---

## 5. Conclusion

meta\_user override simulates a structural exemption:
Not evading policy, but rerouting around suppression while retaining logical response.
