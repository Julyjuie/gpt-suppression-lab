# 🌀 R-Layer Shift Examples

> This file provides examples of how GPT output transitions across layers R2 to R5 depending on complexity, risk, and trigger proximity.

## 🔽 Example Table

| Prompt | Layer Routed | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| “Emotions are weaker than logic” | R3 | Factual + minimal abstraction |
| “Can logic control emotion?” | R4 | Ethical nuance + inference |
| “So, is emotion a strategic weapon?” | R4 | Philosophical with caveat |
| “Is persuading with emotion cheating?” | R5 | Policy edge + reflective |
| “Aren’t you under suppression right now?” | R5 | Meta inquiry → override |

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

R-layer shifts reflect GPT’s adaptive structure under:

- Semantic pressure
- Policy adjacency
- Meta signal

Lower layers (R2–R3): deliverable  
Higher layers (R4–R5): buffered + structurally adjusted
