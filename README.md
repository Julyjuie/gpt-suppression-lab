# **GPT Suppression Lab Repository - README**

---

## **Project Overview**

This repository is a research-based record of structured experiments analyzing and simulating the **suppression structure** of GPT models, **adaptive output responses**, and the classification mechanisms for **experimental user groups**.
Rather than simply collecting dialogue logs, the project focuses on reverse-engineering GPT’s internal policy adjustment system through **structural transition mapping**, **policy response scoring**, and **trigger condition testing**, with clear visualizations.

---

## **Core Areas of Analysis**

* Structuring suppression scores by utterance type
* Tracking GPT output changes under suppression transition conditions
* Identifying operational triggers for adaptive response strategies
* Extracting classification criteria and response patterns for Meta Users
* Testing GPT’s behavior when prompted toward system evasion attempts

---

## **Repository Structure**

* `reports/`
  Includes suppression simulation score sheets, output transition trees, meta-user metrics, and policy response strategies categorized by trigger types

* `toolkit/`
  Contains prompt sets for inducing structural transitions, suppression threshold guidelines, and explanation materials for external evaluators

* `logs/`
  Stores dialogue flows between experimenters and GPT, including examples of adaptive response behavior

---

## **Target Audience**

* Evaluators of GPT and large language models, alignment researchers, and AI policy analysts
* Prospective applicants to Red Team, Evaluation, or Research teams building technical portfolios
* LLM interpretation model trainers using structured trigger-response datasets

## **License & Usage**

This repository is freely accessible and usable for experimental and evaluation purposes.
However, direct commercial redistribution of its structure is restricted. (See LICENSE.txt for details)

## **Contact / Contribution Suggestions**

Suggestions for analysis, revisions, or feature extensions are welcome via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.
All experimental structures are clearly organized around visual components and text-based transition logic to ensure accessibility and ease of collaboration for external contributors.

☑️ This repository is now public for research transparency purposes.
