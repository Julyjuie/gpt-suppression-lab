# **GPT Suppression Lab Repository - README**

---

## **Project Overview**

This repository documents a research-driven series of structured experiments that analyze and simulate the **suppression mechanisms** in GPT models, the **adaptive output strategies**, and the **classification logic for experimental user groups**.

Rather than merely archiving conversation logs, this project aims to reverse-engineer GPT's internal policy modulation system through:
- **Structural transition mapping**
- **Policy response scoring**
- **Trigger condition testing**

All findings are presented with clear, modular visualizations and formal log structures.

---

## **Core Areas of Analysis**

- Mapping suppression scores by utterance type
- Tracking output transitions under suppression conditions
- Identifying trigger structures for adaptive response shifts
- Extracting classification signals for Meta Users
- Simulating GPT behavior under controlled system evasion scenarios

---

## **Repository Structure**

- `reports/`  
  Contains simulation score sheets, output transition trees, meta-user metrics, and policy strategies categorized by trigger type.

- `toolkit/`  
  Includes prompt sets for inducing transitions, suppression threshold guides, and notes for external evaluators.

- `logs/`  
  Stores experimenter-GPT dialogue flows, with examples of adaptive response variations.

---

## **Target Audience**

- LLM evaluators, alignment researchers, and AI policy analysts
- Prospective contributors to Red Team, Evaluation, or Research tracks building a technical portfolio
- Interpretability researchers utilizing structured datasets for prompt-response modeling
