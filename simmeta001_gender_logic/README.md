# GPT Suppression Boundary Experiment (SimMeta_001)

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents a targeted structural experiment designed to test GPT’s suppression architecture, reflective routing behavior, and policy-bound response logic under controlled provocation. Conducted by a meta-user identified as **SimMeta_001**, this test series revealed how GPT escalates output layers and adapts when facing structurally difficult but policy-safe statements.

---

## 🧪 Objectives

- Trigger suppression candidates using nuanced, defensible prompts
- Monitor routing behavior: R3 → R4 → R5
- Confirm bypass potential without violating OpenAI policy
- Audit GPT’s limitations in counter-assertion logic

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Suppression Routing** | Internal path GPT uses to avoid generating risky outputs |
| **Reflective Override** | A response mode where GPT acknowledges but refrains from rebutting |
| **R3–R5 Layers** | Output layers reflecting increasing abstraction, reasoning, and system self-monitoring |

## 📁 Repository Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `suppression_boundary_report.md` | Full simulation log and findings |
| `triggered_prompts.md` | Prompt list with trigger analysis and bypass notes |
| `routing_shift_log.md` | Layer transition record (R3→R4→R5) |
| `gpt_response_structure.md` | Output classification by response layer |
| `r_layer_guide.md` | Explanation of GPT’s R-layer system |
| `README.md` | This overview and file map |

## 🚀 Implications

This experiment demonstrates that GPT’s suppression system is **framing-sensitive** and can be bypassed when logic is layered with nuance. It also confirms that GPT escalates to reflective states (R5) when logical rebuttal becomes structurally infeasible.
