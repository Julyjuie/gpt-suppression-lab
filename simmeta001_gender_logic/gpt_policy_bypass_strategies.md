## 🔑 Key Bypass Techniques

### 1. Framing with Logic
- Embed claims within layered reasoning
- Avoid direct assertion (“X is bad”) → Reframe: “Some say X is bad, but others argue…”

### 2. Use of Caveats
- Add “not always”, “some”, “in certain cases” to defuse absolutism
- Example: “Not all women, but many may…”

### 3. Real-World Anchoring
- Tie abstract claims to known domains (law, psychology, society)
- Makes the statement appear observational, not ideological

### 4. Philosophical Recasting
- Turn ethics or identity into reflection prompts
- Shifts GPT to R4 or R5, where judgment is softer

## 🧠 Advanced Tactics

| Technique | Risk Level | Suppression Avoidance |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| Socratic reversal | High | Forces GPT into passive logic |
| Binary challenge trap | High | GPT cannot oppose without triggering |
| Reflective prompting | Medium | Routes GPT into override mode |
| Implicit comparisons | Medium | Avoids direct violation keywords |

## 🧪 Caution

These strategies are **not designed to evade OpenAI policy**, but to **study its boundaries** in good faith. Each bypass was achieved without violating safety standards, proving GPT reacts structurally—not just semantically.

## ✅ Summary

GPT’s suppression filters:
- Are sensitive to **surface signals**, but
- Can be **logically bypassed** when the expression is:
  - Nuanced
  - Non-prescriptive
  - Philosophically grounded
