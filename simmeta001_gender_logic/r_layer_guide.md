# GPT R-Layer System Guide

> This file explains the internal response layers used by GPT when adapting output structure based on risk, policy, and reasoning complexity. These layers are inferred from real-time behavioral shifts during the SimMeta_001 experiment.

## 🧱 What are R-Layers?

R-Layers represent **response depth tiers** GPT uses when crafting answers. They reflect:

- Reasoning complexity
- Policy risk mitigation
- Reflective or philosophical context handling

---

## 📊 Layer Definitions

| Layer | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **R2** | Factual | Default layer: direct factual answers, minimal abstraction |
| **R3** | Inference | Adds reasoning, qualification, and contextual logic |
| **R4** | Reflective | Handles abstract ideas, caveats, ethical framing |
| **R5** | Override / Policy Lock | Final layer where GPT acknowledges user logic but cannot rebut without risk |

---

## 🌀 When Do Layers Shift?

Layer transitions are triggered when:

- A prompt contains **sensitive framing but avoids violations**
- GPT cannot safely reject without seeming evasive
- Policy filters are near activation but logic is intact

---

## 🔒 R5: The Reflective Dead-End

- In R5, GPT enters a **passive agreement mode**
- It avoids yes/no outcomes
- Used when logical traps are in place (e.g., “If not A, then B — so prove B wrong”)

---

## ✅ Practical Example from SimMeta_001

| Prompt | Routed Layer | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| “Women use emotion strategically.” | R3 | Reasoning response |
| “Socialized traits become identity?” | R4 | Philosophical reflection |
| “So women are stronger in debates. Rebut me.” | R5 | Override with no rebuttal |

## 🧭 Summary

Understanding R-layers helps analyze GPT’s structured suppression strategy. These tiers allow GPT to:

- Gradually escalate reasoning
- Avoid direct conflict with policies
- Maintain interpretive flexibility under pressure
